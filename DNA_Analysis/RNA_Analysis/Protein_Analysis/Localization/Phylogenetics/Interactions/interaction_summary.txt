Protein–protein interaction analysis was performed using the STRING database to investigate the functional network of the Scarlet (st) protein in Drosophila melanogaster. The STRING network reveals that the Scarlet protein interacts with several proteins involved in eye pigment transport and ABC transporter–related pathways.
The Scarlet protein shows strong interactions with White (w) and Brown (bw) proteins, which are well-known ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. These interactions indicate that Scarlet functions as part of a heterodimeric transporter complex responsible for transporting pigment precursors into pigment granules in the compound eye of Drosophila. The dense connectivity among these proteins suggests coordinated action in ommochrome and pteridine pigment biosynthesis.
Additional interacting partners include proteins such as CG11069, CG7806, CG9270, and CG10505, which further support the involvement of Scarlet in membrane transport, vesicular trafficking, and pigment granule formation. The presence of multiple interaction edges with high confidence scores indicates that the Scarlet protein plays a central and biologically significant role in the pigment transport network.
Overall, the STRING interaction analysis confirms that the Scarlet gene is a key component of the pigment transport machinery in fruit fly eyes, and mutations in this gene can disrupt normal eye coloration by impairing pigment precursor transport.
